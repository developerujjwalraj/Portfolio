# Ujjwal Raj — Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website — a clean, modern single-page portfolio built with HTML and CSS.

- Clean profile card with cropped profile photo (top-focused crop) and social links.
- Sections: About, Education, Projects, Skills, Certifications, Contact.

Live preview

- Open `https://developerujjwalraj.github.io/Portfolio/` to view in your web bowser globally.

Files of interest

- `index.html` — main single-page site.
- `styles.css` — styling for layout, hero, and profile card.
- `images/` — contains `Portfolio photo.png` (profile photo).

How the profile photo crop is handled

The profile image uses CSS `object-fit: cover` with `object-position: center top` so the top of the real photo (the head/upper portion) remains visible in the cropped card.

Customizations you might try

- Tweak the vertical crop: in `styles.css` change `object-position: center top` to something like `center 10%` or `center 20%` for fine adjustment.
- Resize the card: change the `.profile-photo` `width` / `height` values to alter visible area.

Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub repo and push this project (see repo settings).
2. In the repo, enable GitHub Pages and choose the `main` branch (root) as the source.
3. Your site will be available at `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>/`.
